# Diabetes_Prediction
Diabetes Prediction using machine learning algorithms

Using all patient records, a machine learning model was built to predict whether the person is having diabetes or not.
Among all the algorithms SVM(support vector machine) gives the  best accuracy. 
Then using a pickle module, the dump() function is used to store the object data into the file.
Now, in VScode the python file, HTML file, and the CSS files were created to make the project user interface.
Using the FLASK web Framework HTML and CSS files were rendered.
